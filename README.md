## 1. Idea and Use Case

This project started out with me working on my open source educational project called [*Project Artemis*](https://github.com/mrbandler/project-artemis) where I will try to completely automate a space program with [Kerbal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/) and the mod [kOS](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/index.html). While writting my first few lines of Kerboscript it became very cumbersome and error prone to see if the written code is compilable without a lot of copying and running KSP. I just wanted to keep productive without a context switch.

This is the solution I came up with, a CLI for managing Kerboscript projects with features to compile, run and deploy Kerboscript with just a simple command, and even with your custom compile and deployment scripts written in entirely in Kerboscript! 

## 2. Installation

The CLI can easily be installed over [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager). Which can be installed by installing [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/).

````shell
> npm install -g ksc
````

That's it, now you're up and running!

> **NOTE**
>
> The package is currently rather big as .NET Core 2.2 does not let me create a self-contained executable with tree shaking. .NET Core 3.0 has all these great features so I will switch to it once it's production ready.

## 3. Usage

**Coming soon...**

## 4. Bugs and Features

Please open a issue when you encounter any bugs üêû or if you have an idea for a additional feature üí°.
